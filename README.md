## 🌌 Abstract
**Project Origin** introduces a novel geometric framework to resolve the $5.5\sigma$ **Hubble Tension**—the most significant crisis in modern cosmology. Based on the **Radial Manifold Projection (RMP)** hypothesis, we propose that the observed discrepancy in expansion rates is not a dynamical energy mystery, but a geometric projection distortion occurring within a high-dimensional spherical manifold.

In Version 2.0, we introduce the **Damped Projection Operator**, which resolves the mathematical collapse at high redshifts found in earlier iterations, making the theory fully compatible with both local SnIa data and global CMB measurements.

## 🧪 The Formula: Damped Projection Model
In the RMP 2.0 framework, the measured Hubble value $H(z)$ is a function of the projection angle:

$$H(z) = H_{CMB} + (H_0 - H_{CMB}) \cdot \text{sech}(\alpha \cdot \ln(1+z))$$

### Key Scientific Breakthroughs:
* **Horizon Safety**: The hyperbolic secant ($\text{sech}$) function replaces the periodic cosine, ensuring $H(z)$ remains positive and smoothly approaches the CMB baseline as $z \to \infty$.
* **Statistical Superiority**: Implements AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) testing to demonstrate that RMP provides a more parsimonious fit than the standard ($\Lambda$)CDM model.
* **Geometric Dark Energy**: Redefines Dark Energy as "projection stress" inherent in the manifold geometry, removing the need for a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$).

## 🛰️ Experimental Extension: The Origin Protocol

Located in the /Origin_Protocol directory, this phase of the project investigates the implications of the Tech-Orb manifold on Quantum Non-locality.

1. **Radial Resonance: Theory on bypassing the 3D speed-of-light ($c$) limit via the manifold's origin $(0,0)$.

2. **Simulation: Includes origin_sync_simulator.py for testing zero-latency information synchronization.

## 💻 Validation & Reproducibility
We provide an automated validation script that pulls real-world data from the **Pantheon+** supernova survey.


## Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the Academic Validation Protocol v2.0
python techorb_validation.py


(The script outputs H(z) fit comparisons, residual analysis, and calculates AIC/BIC scores to determine statistical preference.)
