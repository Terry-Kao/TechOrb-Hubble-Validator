# Theoretical Framework: Radial Manifold Projection (RMP)

## 1. Overview
The **Radial Manifold Projection (RMP)** theory, informally known as the "Tech-Orb" hypothesis, provides a geometric solution to the **Hubble Tension**—the $5.5\sigma$ discrepancy between local ($z \approx 0$) and early-universe ($z \approx 1100$) measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$).

Unlike the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, which attributes the acceleration of the universe to a mysterious Dark Energy fluid, RMP proposes that the observed expansion rate is a byproduct of a **non-linear radial projection** from a 4D spherical manifold onto our observable 3D space-time.

## 2. The Geometric Hypothesis
We postulate that the universe's metric is governed by a **Radial Projection Operator** $\mathbb{P}(\chi)$, where $\chi = \ln(1+z)$ represents the geometric depth (logarithmic redshift).

### 2.1 The Concept of Projection Distortion
As light travels across the manifold, its perceived frequency and the apparent expansion rate are distorted by the curvature of the manifold. This distortion manifests as a change in the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ relative to the global baseline established by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

## 3. Mathematical Evolution: From v1.0 to v2.0
The RMP theory has evolved to ensure mathematical consistency across all cosmological scales.

### 3.1 Legacy Model (v1.0: Periodic Projection)
The initial prototype used a cosine function:
$$H(z) = H_0 \cos(\alpha \ln(1+z)) \quad \text{(Legacy - Deprecated)}$$
**Limitation:** While it fit low-redshift data, it suffered from "Horizon Collapse," where $H(z)$ would turn negative at $z > 3.4$, violating causality and contradicting CMB observations.

### 3.2 Current Model (v2.0: Damped Radial Projection)
To resolve the boundary crisis, RMP v2.0 adopts the **Damped Projection Operator** using the hyperbolic secant ($\text{sech}$) function:
$$H(z) = H_{CMB} + (H_0 - H_{CMB}) \cdot \text{sech}(\alpha \cdot \ln(1+z))$$

**Why Sech?**
1. **Positivity Constraint:** $\text{sech}(x)$ is strictly positive, ensuring $H(z) > 0$ for all $z$.
2. **Asymptotic Stability:** As $z \to \infty$, $\text{sech}(\alpha \ln(1+z)) \to 0$. This forces the observed Hubble rate to smoothly settle into the global CMB baseline ($H_{CMB} \approx 67.4$ km/s/Mpc).
3. **Smooth Transition:** It naturally bridges the gap between the "Hubble Bubble" observed by SH0ES and the global expansion measured by Planck.

## 4. Observational Link: Luminosity Distance
To maintain academic rigor, the RMP model is not directly fitted to $H(z)$ (which is not a direct observable at high $z$). Instead, it is validated against the **Distance Modulus ($\mu$)** of Type Ia Supernovae.

The theory defines the **Luminosity Distance ($d_L$)** through a numerical integration of the RMP metric:
$$d_L(z) = (1+z) c \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{H_{RMP}(z')}$$

This approach accounts for the full null-geodesic path of photons, ensuring that our validation against the **Pantheon+** dataset is statistically sound and free from the systematic errors found in low-redshift approximations.

## 5. Geometric "Dark Energy"
In this framework, the "acceleration" of the universe is an **apparent effect**. The "stress" generated by the manifold's radial projection mimics the effect of a Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$). By adjusting the geometric scaling factor $\alpha$, the RMP model can replicate the observed $\mu(z)$ curves without invoking new dark particles or fields.

## 6. Conclusion
RMP v2.0 (Damped Projection) transforms the Hubble Tension from a cosmological crisis into a geometric proof. By replacing the periodic cosine with a damped hyperbolic metric, we achieve a unified description of the universe from the local neighborhood to the cosmic horizon.
