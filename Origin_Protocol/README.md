# Origin Protocol: High-Dimensional Synchronicity & Information Topology

> **Status:** Phase 3 - Speculative/Theoretical Research  
> **Warning:** This module explores hypothetical extensions of the RMP theory and is distinct from the statistically validated cosmological models in the main repository.

## 🌌 Overview
While the main **Radial Manifold Projection (RMP)** theory focuses on resolving the Hubble Tension through geometric distortion, the **Origin Protocol** explores the radical implications of the "Origin Point" ($z \to \infty$) within the manifold. 

This protocol investigates the possibility of **Non-Local Geometric Synchronicity**—a hypothesis suggesting that if space-time is a projection, then the "Source" (The Origin) may allow for information correlations that bypass traditional 3D causal constraints.

## ⚖️ Academic Disclaimer & Research Boundary
This section contains **Speculative Physics** and should be treated as a theoretical exploration (Level 3) rather than a validated empirical result (Level 1). 

1. **Causality & Relativity:** The simulations provided here do not claim to violate Special Relativity within 3D Minkowski space. Instead, they model "Correlation Peaks" derived from high-dimensional manifold alignment.
2. **Separation of Concerns:** The validity of the RMP solution to the Hubble Tension (provided in `techorb_validation.py`) does *not* depend on the success or failure of the Origin Protocol. 
3. **Experimental Status:** These concepts currently lack direct experimental evidence and are presented for "Thought Experiment" and "Information Topology" simulation purposes only.

## 📡 Simulation: Origin Sync Simulator
The included scripts (`origin_sync_simulator.py`) model the cross-correlation of signals under the assumption of a shared geometric origin. 
* **Note:** This is a statistical manifestation of manifold projection, intended to stimulate discussion on quantum entanglement and geometric non-locality.
