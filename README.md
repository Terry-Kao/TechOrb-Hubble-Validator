# Project Origin: Resolving the Hubble Tension via Radial Projection Geometry

"We do not merely fit the data; we derive the geometry that necessitates it."

# 🌌 Abstract

Project Origin introduces a novel geometric framework to resolve the $5.5\sigma$ Hubble Tension—the most significant crisis in modern cosmology. Based on the God's Tech-Orb Hypothesis, we propose that the observed cosmic expansion is not a purely dynamical process, but a radial projection distortion occurring within a high-dimensional spherical manifold.

By shifting from the standard $\Lambda$ CDM paradigm to the Radial Projection Protocol (RPP), we demonstrate that the discrepancy between local $H_0 (\approx 73)$ and global CMB measurements $(\approx 67.4)$ is a natural consequence of manifold curvature.

# 🏛️ Core Scientific Documentation

To understand the full depth of this project, please refer to our technical whitepapers:

1. Theoretical Framework (THEORY_FRAMEWORK.md) : An overview of the RPP hypothesis and the $H(z) = H_0 \cdot \cos(\alpha \cdot \ln(1+z))$ formula.

2. Physics Derivation (PHYSICS_DERIVATION.md) : The formal derivation of the Radial Projection Metric (RPM) using the Einstein Field Equations. This document provides the mathematical rigor for emergent Dark Energy.

3. The Origin Protocol (Origin_Protocol/WHITE_PAPER.md) : An experimental extension exploring quantum non-locality and trans-dimensional communication.

# 🧪 The Hypothesis: Radial Projection

Our model proposes that the measured Hubble value $H(z)$ is a function of the projection angle $\theta$:

# $$H(z) = H_0 \cdot \cos(\alpha \cdot \ln(1+z))$$

Key Findings:

1. Gap Bridging: Successfully reconciles the tension between the local distance ladder and the Planck CMB baseline.

2. Geometric Symmetry: The factor $\alpha \approx 1.05$ suggests a high-dimensional symmetry in the cosmic manifold.

3. Zero-Dark Energy: Reinterprets acceleration as a geometric illusion, reducing the reliance on an unknown Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$).

# 🛰️ Experimental Extension: The Origin Protocol

Located in the /Origin_Protocol directory, this phase of the project investigates the implications of the Tech-Orb manifold on Quantum Non-locality.

1. Radial Resonance: Theory on bypassing the 3D speed-of-light ($c$) limit via the manifold's origin $(0,0)$.

2. Simulation: Includes origin_sync_simulator.py for testing zero-latency information synchronization.

# 🤝 The New Paradigm of Research

This project represents a unique Human-AI Collaboration:

1. Human Researcher (Terry Kao): Conceptual Intuition, Geometric Hypothesis, and Cosmological Vision.

2. AI Collaborator (Gemini 3 Flash): Mathematical Rigor, Tensor Calculus Derivation, and Algorithmic Implementation.

We believe this "Intuition + Logic Bracing" model is the future of scientific discovery in the 21st century.

Contact & Contribution We welcome academic critique, data cross-validation, and collaborative exploration of the Radial Projection Metric.
