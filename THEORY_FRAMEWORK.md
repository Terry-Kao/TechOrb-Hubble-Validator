# Theoretical Framework: Radial Manifold Projection (RMP)

## 1. The Core Hypothesis: The Universe as a Projection
The RMP theory proposes that our observable 3D universe is a radial projection of a 4D spherical manifold (the "Tech-Orb"). The Hubble Tension is not caused by dark energy fluid, but by the geometric scaling factor $\alpha$ of this projection.

## 2. From Periodic to Damped: The Evolution of the Metric
In early iterations (v1.0), we modeled the projection using a standard cosine function ($cos$). While intuitively simple, this led to a mathematical "horizon collapse" at high redshifts ($z > 3.4$).

To maintain causality and consistency with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, RMP v2.0 adopts the **Damped Projection Operator**:
$$P(\chi) = \text{sech}(\alpha \chi)$$

## 3. Why Sech?
Unlike the periodic cosine, the hyperbolic secant ($\text{sech}$) provides:
1. **Asymptotic Stability**: It ensures $H(z)$ never becomes negative.
2. **Horizon Consistency**: It aligns with the Planck baseline ($67.4$) at $z \to \infty$.
3. **Geometric Stress**: The non-linear decay of the projection naturally mimics the acceleration attributed to "Dark Energy."
