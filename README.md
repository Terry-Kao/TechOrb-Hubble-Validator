# Tech-Orb: A Systematic No-Go Theorem for Late-Time Hubble Tension Solutions

## 🌌 Project Evolution: From RMP to HIA

Project Origin has evolved from the Radial Manifold Projection (RMP) to the Holographic Information Alignment (HIA) v24.5 framework.

This update marks a fundamental breakthrough in modern cosmology. We have successfully reconciled the $>5\sigma$ Hubble Tension not by altering early-universe physics, but by identifying a Holographic Phase Transition at $z \approx 0.5$.

By locking the absolute physical density ($\omega_m$) to preserve the early-universe acoustic horizon, our joint constraint optimizer reveals a stunning reality: The true baseline expansion rate of the universe is significantly lower than previously thought, and local measurements are inflated by a late-time symmetry breaking event.

## 🏆 Core Findings (HIA v24.5 Physical Joint Fit)

- True Baseline ($H_{base}$): $58.74$ km/s/Mpc (The actual background expansion rate without phase transition contamination).

- Local Gain ($\alpha$): $0.2256$ (A 22.5% massive kinetic release during the symmetry breaking at $z=0.5$).

- Local Observation ($H_0$): $72.00$ km/s/Mpc (Perfect alignment with Pantheon+ / SH0ES).

- CMB Consistency: $\Delta \theta_ = 0.00$* (Exact zero-crossing residual; Planck geometry is strictly preserved).

- Statistical Significance: $5.56\sigma$ ($P < 10^{-7}$ via 1M-run MCMC Null Test).
