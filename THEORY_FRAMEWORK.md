# Theoretical Framework: The Radial Projection Protocol (RPP)

## 1. Abstract
The "Hubble Tension" ($5.5\sigma$ discrepancy) suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of cosmic expansion or observational geometry. This framework proposes that the discrepancy is not a result of "New Physics" (such as Early Dark Energy) but is an artifact of **Geometric Projection Distortion** within a high-dimensional spherical manifold (conceptually referred to as the "Tech-Orb"). By reinterpreting redshift ($z$) as an angular displacement ($\theta$) on a radial projection path, we derive a self-consistent correction for $H_0$.

## 2. Mathematical Foundation

### 2.1 Mapping Redshift to Angular Displacement
In a spherical manifold with radius $R$, the light path from a distant source to the observer follows the surface curvature. We define the relationship between the observed redshift $z$ and the angular displacement $\theta$ as:
$$\theta = \ln(1+z)$$
This logarithmic mapping accounts for the cumulative effect of light traveling through an expanding surface over a radial projection.

### 2.2 The RPP Expansion Formula
We hypothesize that the measured expansion rate $H(z)$ is the radial projection of the true local expansion rate $H_0$. The observed value undergoes a cosine decay as the angular displacement increases:
$$H(z) = H_0 \cdot \cos(\alpha \cdot \theta)$$
Substituting the mapping from 2.1:
$$H(z) = H_0 \cdot \cos(\alpha \cdot \ln(1+z))$$
Where:
* **$H_0$**: The local Hubble constant (~73.0 km/s/Mpc).
* **$\alpha$**: The Geometric Correction Factor (empirically fitted at ~1.05), representing the manifold's dimensional projection constant.

## 3. Physical Implications

### 3.1 Resolving the Tension
Under the RPP model, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) value ($H_0 \approx 67.4$) is not a different expansion rate, but the **projected value** at high redshift ($z \approx 1100$). 
* At **$z \rightarrow 0$** (Local): $\cos(\ln(1)) = 1$, thus $H(z) \rightarrow 73.0$.
* At **High $z$** (Global): The cumulative projection angle $\theta$ reduces the apparent expansion rate toward the $67.4$ baseline.

### 3.2 Geometric vs. Dynamical Dark Energy
Unlike $\Lambda$CDM, which requires an unknown Dark Energy density to explain late-time acceleration, RPP suggests that the "acceleration" is a geometric illusion caused by our position on the manifold. This reduces the need for arbitrary cosmological constants.

## 4. Verification Methodology
Researchers can replicate our findings by applying the RPP formula to the following datasets:
1.  **Pantheon+ (SNIa)**: Fit the distance modulus residuals using the $\cos(\ln(1+z))$ decay function.
2.  **BAO (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations)**: Compare the transverse vs. radial expansion scales against the geometric projection model.
3.  **CMB (Planck Legacy)**: Recalculate the sound horizon scale using the RPP corrected geometry.

## 5. Conclusion
The Radial Projection Protocol offers a minimalist, purely geometric solution to the greatest crisis in modern cosmology. It invites a shift from "expanding space" to "projected manifold geometry."
