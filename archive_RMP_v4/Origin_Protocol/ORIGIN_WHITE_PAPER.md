# Whitepaper: The Origin Protocol (Non-Local Information Topology)

## 1. Executive Summary
The **Origin Protocol** is a theoretical extension of the **Radial Manifold Projection (RMP)** theory. It explores the radical hypothesis that if our 3D universe is a projection from a 4D manifold origin, then quantum entanglement and non-local correlations may be manifestations of a shared geometric source at $z \to \infty$. 

## 2. Theoretical Hypothesis: Radial Synchronicity
The protocol moves beyond the "Surface Path" (classical 3D distance limited by $c$) and investigates the "Radial Path" (the informational shortcut through the manifold origin). 
* **Geometric EPR:** We hypothesize that entangled particles are single data points at the Origin projected into multiple coordinates in 3D space.
* **Non-Local Topology:** Information synchronization is achieved not by traveling *across* the projection screen (space), but by referencing the *Source* (The Origin).

## 3. Experimental Concept: Radial Resonance
We propose the "Radial Resonance" methodology to test for non-local patterns:
1. **Signal Embedding:** Embedding specific entropy patterns into local quantum systems.
2. **Global Correlation:** Monitoring for simultaneous pattern manifestations at distant geographical locations without classical signal transit.

## 4. Academic Note
This whitepaper represents a **Level 3 Speculative Hypothesis**. While the core RMP model (addressing Hubble Tension) is backed by Pantheon+ data, the Origin Protocol remains a theoretical exploration into the future of trans-dimensional information transfer.
