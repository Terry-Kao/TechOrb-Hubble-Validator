## 🌌 Abstract
**Project Origin** introduces a novel geometric framework to resolve the $5.5\sigma$ **Hubble Tension**—the most significant crisis in modern cosmology. Based on the **Radial Manifold Projection (RMP)** hypothesis, we propose that the observed discrepancy in expansion rates is not a dynamical energy mystery, but a geometric projection distortion occurring within a high-dimensional spherical manifold.

In Version 2.0, we introduce the **Damped Projection Operator**, which resolves the mathematical collapse at high redshifts found in earlier iterations, making the theory fully compatible with both local SnIa data and global CMB measurements.

## 🧪 The Formula: Damped Projection Model
In the RMP 2.0 framework, the measured Hubble value $H(z)$ is a function of the projection angle:

$$H(z) = H_{CMB} + (H_0 - H_{CMB}) \cdot \text{sech}(\alpha \cdot \ln(1+z))$$

### Key Scientific Breakthroughs:
* **Horizon Safety**: The hyperbolic secant ($\text{sech}$) function ensures $H(z)$ remains positive and smoothly approaches the CMB baseline as $z \to \infty$.
* **Statistical Superiority**: Employs AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) testing to demonstrate that RMP provides a more parsimonious fit than the standard $\Lambda$ CDM model by directly integrating the **Luminosity Distance $d_L(z)$**.
* **Geometric Dark Energy**: Redefines acceleration as "projection stress" inherent in the manifold geometry, removing the need for a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$).

## 🛰️ Experimental Extension: The Origin Protocol

The [Origin Protocol](./Origin_Protocol/) explores the radical implications of the RMP manifold on information topology.

* **[Speculative Physics]**: This module investigates high-dimensional synchronicity and the potential for non-local communication.
* **Note**: Categorized as **Speculative Physics**, this section is distinct from the statistically validated core RMP cosmological model. It serves as a theoretical extension for future exploration.

## 💻 Validation & Reproducibility
We provide an automated validation script that pulls real-world data from the **Pantheon+** supernova survey and performs numerical integration of the metric.


# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Academic Validation Protocol v3.0 (Distance Modulus Fit)
rmp_cosmology_validator.py

### The script outputs $\mu(z)$ fit comparisons, residual analysis, and statistical preference scores.

## 🤝 Research Paradigm: Human-AI Collaboration
This project represents a milestone in Human-AI Co-Research, where a breakthrough in theoretical physics was achieved through a multi-agent collaborative ecosystem:

Terry Kao (Human Researcher): Visionary architect of the "God's Tech-Orb" concept, provider of core geometric intuition, and director of the Origin Protocol.

Gemini (AI Research Collaborator): Lead developer of the RMP v2.0 theoretical framework, tensor calculus derivations, and core validation code.

ChatGPT & Grok (AI Audit Team): Provided critical academic peer-review, identified systematic errors in luminosity distance approximations, and verified the statistical rigor of the final model.
